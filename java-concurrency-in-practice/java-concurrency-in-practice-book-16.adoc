== Chapter 16: The Java Memory Model (JMM)

Problem:   The best and the bad practices in Java concurrency and parallel programming.
           What is the memory model needed for and how it works in Java.

=== What is a memory model and why is needed?

There are number of reasons when a change made by one thread might not be immediately
visible to other threads.

Compilers may generate instructions in a different order than the "obvious" one suggested by the source code,
or store variables in registers instead of in memory; processors may execute instructions in parallel
or out of order; caches may vary the order in which writes to variables are committed to main memory;
and values stored in processor-local caches may not be visible to other processors.

The main memory location could be stale in context of operations done
by other threads on different processors.

The JMM specifies the minimal guarantees the JVM must make about when writes
to variables become visible to other threads.

Instead we would need to use platform specific memory barriers and other platform
specific tools the JMM defines a model for JVM independent to platform the program
runs at.

The previous chapters were describing a `race conditions` (unlucky timing of operations
may cause other than expected results).
There is as well `data race` where reordering of operations (not visible in the source code) may occur.

A data race occurs when a variable is read by more than one thread, and written by at least one thread,
but the reads and writes are not ordered by _happens-before_.

The rules for _happens-before_ are:

* *Program order rule.*
  Each action in a thread _happens-before_ every action in that thread that
  comes later in the program order.
* *Monitor lock rule.*
  An unlock on a monitor lock _happens-before_ every subsequent lock on that same monitor lock.
* *Volatile variable rule.*
  A write to a `volatile` field _happens-before_ every subsequent read of that same field.
* *Thread start rule.*
  A call to `Thread.start` on a thread _happens-before_ every action in the started thread.
* *Thread  termination  rule.*
  Any  action  in  a  thread  _happens-before_  any  other  thread  detects  that  thread  has
  terminated, either by successfully return from `Thread.join` or by `Thread.isAlive` returning `false`.
* *Interruption rule.*
  A thread calling  interrupt on another thread _happens-before_ the interrupted thread detects the
  interrupt (either by having `InterruptedException` thrown, or invoking `isInterrupted` or  interrupted).
* *Finalizer rule.*
  The end of a constructor for an object _happens-before_ the start of the finalizer for that object.
* *Transitivity.*
  If A _happens-before_ B, and B _happens-before_ C, then A _happens-before_ C.

NOTE: explicit `Lock` has the same memory semantics as the intrinsic locks
      and `Atomic` variables have the same memory semantics as the `volatile` variables

=== How to tune the _happens-before_ ordering?

If we know what we are doing we can use piggybacking on synchronization.

In such case we are using the knowledge of the memory model - e.g. we know that
everything before `volatile` write will be visible for any subsequent volatile read.

For this reason the state variable can't be synchronized or `volatile` and use
of `volatile` for another variable defined in precise source code ordering
(this is potential danger as ordering of source code matters here)
will cause the correct memory visibility of the non-volatile one.
