== Main idea

Problem:   Writing Java program performance is not an easy task.
Solution:  Using these several points may help your program to run faster.
Benefit:   The program runs faster (but they are not necessarily more readable)

== Details

=== Why not to use string concatenation?

JVM creates `StringBuilder` in the background. If you concatenate multiple times
multiple `StringBuilder`+s are created. Mutliple objects consumes more memory.

[NOTE]
====
do not use http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuffer.html[`StringBuffer`])
====


=== Why to avoid regular expressions?

They are expensive. For performance avoid at all cost.
If really needed at least cache the http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[`Pattern`]
reference instead of compiling it afresh all the time.

[NOTE]
====
beware variety of JDK `String` method use regular expressions like `String.replaceAll()` or `String.split()`
====


=== Why not to use iterator?

[source, java]
----
for (String value : strings) {
    // Do something useful here
}
----

Every time you run into this `Iterable` loop you will create a new Iterator instance.
If youâ€™re using an `ArrayList`, this is going to be allocating an object with 3 ints on your heap.

On hot code path it's often better to use index-based iteration instead.


=== Why to use primitive types?

An `Object` requires a data on heap. That means GC.

[source,java]
----
// Three heap objects!
Integer[] i = { 1337, 424242 };

// One heap object.
int[] i = { 1337, 424242 };
----

[NOTE]
====
Exception: `boolean` and `byte` have few enough values to be cached entirely by the JDK.

But! only if auto-boxed or with `<Type>.valueOf()`.
Do not call constructor on wrapper types, unless you really want a new instance.
====


=== Why to avoid recursion?

You may be wasting a lot of stack frames for something that could be implemented
with a few local variables.

[NOTE]
====
Some languages has an tail-recursing optimization, especially functional programming languages,
that avoids the trouble with stack frames.
====


=== Why to use `entrySet()`

When iterating over `Map` use

[source,java]
----
for (Entry<K, V> entry : map.entrySet()) {
    K key = entry.getKey();
    V value = entry.getValue();
}
----

rather than

[source,java]
----
for (K key : map.keySet()) {
    V value : map.get(key);
}
----

With the later one you proceed unnecessary map access operations with the `map.get(key)`.


=== Why to consider using `EnumSet` and `EnumMap`

These are types when you know number of possible keys in advance.
They are good for example for configuration map - global for whole application
with parameters known at the application startup.

Java compiler generates constant ordinals for these types
and access to them is faster then with `HashMap` where `hashCode()` and `equals()`
has to be used on every access.


=== Why and how to optimize `hashCode()` and `equal()`

`hashCode()` and `equal()` are particurarly important for `HashMap` accesses.
`HashMap` uses first hash code to define a bin and when multiple records
goes to the same bin then the `equal()` is used to differentiate them
and records are put to a linked list (or tree for a bigger number of items).

Rule of thumb: try to find the simplest and fastest possible `hashCode()` method.

Abort every `equals()` method early, if:

* `this == argument`
* `this` "incompatible type" argument (use `instanceof`, this condition includes `argument == null`)
