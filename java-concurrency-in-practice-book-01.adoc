== Main idea

Problem:   The best and the bad practices in Java concurrency and parallel programming

== Chapter 1

=== What are the properties that the concurrent program needs to consider?

The concurrent programs need to care about correctness/safety and liveness.

Safety means that program runs correctly even when the functionality is run in parallel threads
(thread safety) and liveness refers to fact that program will eventually get to the result.

== Chapter 2

=== What is in core of writing thread-safe program?

The core of the thread-safe program is about managing *state*, in particular a shared (amongst multiple threads) mutable state.

Whenever one than one thread accesses a given state variable, and one of them might write to it,
they all have to coordinate their access to it using *synchronization*.

=== What are java primitives connected with term *synchronization*?

* synchronized keyword (provides exclusive locking)
* volatile variables
* explicit locks
* atomic variables

=== What is the thread-safety?

In core of thread-safety is the concept of *correctness*.

Correctness means that a class conforms to its specification. A good specification
defines invariants constraining an objectâ€™s state and postconditions describing the
effects of its operations.

We usually don't have adequate specification so we can say more loosely that we know that
single-threaded program is correct as we can see it.
Multithreaded program is cannot be thread-safe if the single threaded is not.
We can specify the thread-safety that the multithreaded program then can't break the correctness
more that the single-threaded did.

=== What is atomicity?

An action that executes as a single indivisible operation.

== What is a lost update?

An issue for multithreaded programs where one thread loads a state, meanwhile other
thread loads a state then the first one makes an operation and writes the updated state
back to memory.
The second thread then calculates something based on the old loaded state and write
it to memory. The calculation of the first thread is lost.

=== What is race condition?

A race condition occurs when the correctness of a computation depends
on the relative timing or interleaving of multiple threads by the runtime
&ndash; when getting the right answer relies on lucky timing.

=== How to specify an compound action?

The compound action is an operation that consists from multiple actions.
This means the operation is not atomic (indivisible). Then interleaving threads
may process the actions arbitrarily and race condition may occur.

To ensure thread safety, *check-then-act* operations (like lazy initialization where we check for `if null then create`)
and *read-modify-write* operations (like increment where we update the state with an counter increment)
must always be atomic.

=== What is intrinsic lock?

It's an built-in locking mechanism enforcing atomicity which is determined with keyword `synchronized`.
The intrinsic locks are called *monitor locks* as well.

Intrinsic locks in Java act as *mutexes* (or mutual exclusion locks).
If one thread holds the lock then all other have to wait (blocked with processing)
until the lock is released. If the thread never releases the lock then the second
thread waits forever.

A *synchronized method* is a shorthand for a synchronized block that spans an entire method body
and whose lock is the object on which the method is being invoked.
*Static synchronized methods* use the Class object for the lock.

.synchronized block locking on explicit object named 'lock'
[source,java]
----
synchronized (lock) {
  // Access or modify shared state guarded by lock
}
----

=== What reentrancy means?

When a thread holds the lock then other thread has to wait for it being released.
But if the same thread, as holding the lock, tries to squire the lock it succeeds.
That's reentrancy.

Reentrancy means that lock is acquired per-thread basis rather than per-invocation
(default POSIX thread mutexes - pthreads - are acquired per-invocation).

Reentrancy is implemented by having a counter associated to each lock. On lock acquisition
the counter is increased. When the counter of the lock lock is decreased to zero lock is released.
