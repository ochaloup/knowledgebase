== Chapter 10: Avoiding Liveness Hazards

Problem:   The best and the bad practices in Java concurrency and parallel programming.
           How to omit deadlock, what are the design decision precluding the conditions that could cause it, what are causes of liveness failures.

=== How to avoid deadlock threats?

For precluding the deadlock the global order of acquiring locks has to be defined.

> A program will be free of lockÍ²ordering deadlocks if all threads acquire
> the locks they need in a fixed global order.

For example example of deadlock-prone code where depends on the outer code
to pass the order of arguments. If one thread will transfer money from account X to Y,
and another thread from Y to X, the deadlock may easily occur.

[source,java]
----
public void transferMoney(Account fromAccount, Account toAccount, DollarAmount amount) throws InsufficientFundsException {
  synchronized (fromAccount) {
    synchronized (toAccount) {
      if (fromAccount.getBalance().compareTo(amount) < 0)
        throw new InsufficientFundsException();
      else {
        fromAccount.debit(amount);
        toAccount.credit(amount);
      }
    }
  }
}
----

An possible solution is e.g. use the lock ordering defined by object hash code
(we need to add the `tie` option. The hash code won't be equal often and thus global lock
will not contend our application with high possibility)

[source,java]
----
void transferMoney(final Account fromAcct, final Account toAcct, final DollarAmount amount) throws InsufficientFundsException {
  class Helper {
    public void transfer() throws InsufficientFundsException {
      if (fromAcct.getBalance().compareTo(amount) < 0)
        throw new InsufficientFundsException();
      else {
        fromAcct.debit(amount);
        toAcct.credit(amount);
      }
    }
  }

  int fromHash = System.identityHashCode(fromAcct);
  int toHash = System.identityHashCode(toAcct);
  if (fromHash < toHash) {
    synchronized (fromAcct) {
      synchronized (toAcct) {
        new Helper().transfer();
      }
    }
  } else if (fromHash > toHash) {
    synchronized (toAcct) {
      synchronized (fromAcct) {
        new Helper().transfer();
      }
    }
  } else {
    synchronized (tieLock) {
      synchronized (fromAcct) {
        synchronized (toAcct) {
          new Helper().transfer();
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

=== What is open calls?

Open call is a call of a method when a the time of calling there is no lock held.
When calling a method - unknown, alien one - and we hold a lock there is a good potential
to a long striving lock or a deadlock.
When calling a method - known and controlled one - we may be checking the method does not take
long time but in case of some issue any locking trouble is much harder for investigation.

NOTE: Strive to use open calls throughout your program. Programs that rely on open calls are far easier to analyze for
      deadlock-freedom than those that allow calls to alien methods with locks held.

=== What are other things which may cause a deadlock?

When taking a resource and a pool is used. We take a connection to DB #1 and waiting
for a connection to DB #2. Other thread takes a connection to DB #2 and waits for the #1.

=== What are other liveness hazards other than the deadlock?

* Starvation
* Poor responsiveness
* Livelock

=== How to investigate a deadlock?

Use the threaddump - `jstack -l <pid>`.

To trigger a thread dump, you can send the JVM process a `SIGQUIT` signal (`kill -3`) on Unix platforms,
or press the `Ctrl-\` key on Unix or `Ctrl-Break` on Windows platforms.

Found one Java-level deadlock:
=============================
"ApplicationServerThread":
  waiting to lock monitor 0x080f0cdc (a MumbleDBConnection),
  which is held by "ApplicationServerThread"
"ApplicationServerThread":
  waiting to lock monitor 0x080f0ed4 (a MumbleDBCallableStatement),
  which is held by "ApplicationServerThread"

Java stack information for the threads listed above:
  "ApplicationServerThread":
    at MumbleDBConnection.remove_statement
    - waiting to lock <0x650f7f30> (a MumbleDBConnection)
    at MumbleDBStatement.close
    - locked <0x6024ffb0> (a MumbleDBCallableStatement)
    ...

  "ApplicationServerThread":
    at MumbleDBCallableStatement.sendBatch
    - waiting to lock <0x6024ffb0> (a MumbleDBCallableStatement)
    at MumbleDBConnection.commit
    - locked <0x650f7f30> (a MumbleDBConnection)
