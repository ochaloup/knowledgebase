== Main idea

Problem:   Parallel and serial collectors stops the world unpredictable. G1 still requires stop-the-world pause times.
Solution:  Having a garbage collector which is capable to run with as small as possible stop-the-world pause times and being able to work on huge heaps.
Benefit:   Application may run more smoothly without worrying about GC pause times.

== Details

=== What are the properties that ZGC has?

* capable to manage huge heaps
* pause times are short (won't exceed 10ms)
* pause times do not increase with size of heap (number of live objects)

=== What are the characteristics of ZGC?

* concurrent (runs while the application threads run)
* region-based
* compacting
* NUMA-aware (every core has got own separated memory for its processing)
* using colored pointers
* using load barriers

=== How ZGC works?

As any other GC the ZGC needs to find objects for garbage collecting by marking them first
&ndash; it uses *colored pointers* to mark the object as a garbage (ZGC uses the `marked0` and `marked1` metadata bits for marking.)
When objects are marked for GC then it runs *relocation* to compact the heap memory
and get rid of the garbage.

=== How marking works?

Marking works in three phases

* finding the root references (the ones which are starting points to access heap - e.g. local variables, static fields...), it's stop-the-world phase
* traversing object graphs and finding all live objects (using *colored pointers* to mark live objects)
* handling edge cases (e.g. weak references), it's stop-the-world phase

=== What is principle of colored pointers?

GC needs, first, to mark non-living objects in memory and then they are garbage collected (in the next phase).
This means there is created a set of the objects for garbage collection. Some auxiliary
data structure needs to be created normally - e.g. some map which contains addresses with "free to collect" objects.

But ZGC has got nothing like this. It uses the pointers itself to store information about state of the object.
ZGC works only for 64 bit processors. The 42 bits (up to 4TB address memory) for addressing memory
and then 4 bits for marking (coloring) the state of the object that the pointer points to.

* `finalizable bit` – the object is only reachable through a finalizer
* `remap bit` – the reference is up to date and points to the current location of the object (see relocation)
* `marked0` and `marked1` bits – these are used to mark reachable objects

=== How relocation works?

Relocation consists of two phases.

In a concurrent phase object references good for *relocation* are placed into the *relocation set*.
During stop-the-world phase all root references are relocated and their references are updated.
Then the concurrent phase relocate rest of the objects. It stores the mapping between the old and new addresses in the *forwarding table*.
The rest of the references are updated during next(!) marking phase.

=== What is principle of load barriers?

Load barrier is a piece of code which is executed at time when an object accesses
its reference. When it takes the pointer and accesses the memory with a live object.
